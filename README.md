# krttdkit

`krttdkit` is a Python package with tools for visualization and analysis of
N-dimensional data, as well as a set of standards and scripts for the acquisition
and processing of satellite and model data from multiple sources.

The package is broadly separated into stateless modules `acquire`, `operate`, and
`visualize`, as well as a module containing higher-level classes for more complex
use cases called `products`.

This is a "living" codebase that's constantly under development as I
integrate new functionality from homework and research code.

krttd stands for __Keep Running Through The Dark__
