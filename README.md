# krttdkit

`krttdkit` is a Python package with tools for visualization and analysis of
1D and 2D data, as well as a set of standards and scripts for the acquisition
of satellite and model data from several sources.


### Project history

This project started as a collection of code for downloading and visualizing
ABI data in Fall 2022 during my Satellite Meteorology (aes572) course with
Dr. Mecikalski ([branch link][1]).

During Satellite Remote Sensing (aes670) with Dr. Christopher, I started
adapting the code into an installable package for my own convenience ([repo link][2]),
and developing a workflow for cleanly new code into the framework.

This is a "living" codebase that's constantly under development as I
integrate new functionality from homework and research code.

krttd stands for __Keep Running Through The Dark__
